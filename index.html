<p>Every independent nation has a national flag of its own. It is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a free nation. <u>As a free nation, Bangladesh has got a flag of her own</u>. The people of our country feel proud of her flag because it means that Bangladesh is a free and sovereign country. Our national flag reminds us of the valiant struggle of our freedom fighters to set the country free. The shape of our national flag is rectangular having a proportion of 10:6.</p>

<p>Flood is one of the natural disasters and most risky. It happens when too much water is collected in any area. It often happens because of heavy rain. The overflow of rivers causing this natural disaster is widespread in rural areas. Moreover, the melting of snow also occurs. The dam breaking down is another reason for flooding. In our opinion of the coastal regions, flooding is caused by storms and tsunamis. The flood control and long term effects of flooding can be seen in this essay. Low-pressure systems or winds are allowing this. It is also due to human actions that heavy rain is caused.</p>

<p><u>A library is a place which can help a man to satisfy his unquenchable thirst for knowledge</u>. A school library is a part and parcel of an educational institution. Our school  has a rich library. It is housed in a separate building. Our school library  is well-decorated. There are three big rooms in it. Two rooms are used as reading rooms. Boys and girls have separate rooms. In the other room, books are arranged in almirahs. There are about 5,000 books in our library. They include many reference books on different subjects. It also contains some rare books on history and culture. Only the students can read and borrow books from the library. For this, they have to issue library cards. A student can borrow two or three books at a time and keep them at home for a week. But in the reading room, he is allowed to read as many books as he can. It remains open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on holidays. Our school library is a great attraction for us. We are really proud of it.</p>
